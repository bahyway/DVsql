# 3. Satellite

<mark style="color:blue;">**Data Vault v.1.0:**</mark>

In Data Vault v.1.0, the Satellites table is used to store historical or descriptive information about a HUB table. The Satellites table contains a foreign key that references the HUB table, as well as any additional attributes that are relevant to the entity or relationship.

Here is an example of a Satellites table in Data Vault v.1.0:

```sql
CREATE TABLE CustomerSat (
  CustomerID INTEGER NOT NULL,
  CustomerName VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL,
  EffectiveFrom DATETIME NOT NULL,
  EffectiveTo DATETIME NOT NULL,
  CONSTRAINT PK_CustomerSat PRIMARY KEY (CustomerID, EffectiveFrom),
  CONSTRAINT FK_CustomerSat_CustomerHub FOREIGN KEY (CustomerID) REFERENCES CustomerHub (CustomerID)
);
s
```

In this example, the CustomerSat table contains a foreign key that references the CustomerHub table, as well as Effective From and Effective To timestamps that define the period during which the attributes in the Satellite are valid.

<mark style="color:blue;">**Data Vault v.2.0:**</mark>

In Data Vault v.2.0, the Satellites table is used in a similar way to v.1.0, but with some enhancements. In addition to the foreign key that references the HUB table, the Satellites table also includes a Hash Key, which is a system-generated key that is based on the values of the foreign key attributes and any additional attributes that are relevant to the entity or relationship.

Here is an example of a Satellites table in Data Vault v.2.0:

```sql
CREATE TABLE CustomerSat (
  CustomerHashKey VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,
  CustomerName VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL,
  EffectiveFrom DATETIME NOT NULL,
  EffectiveTo DATETIME NOT NULL,
  CONSTRAINT PK_CustomerSat PRIMARY KEY (CustomerHashKey, EffectiveFrom),
  CONSTRAINT FK_CustomerSat_CustomerHub FOREIGN KEY (CustomerHashKey) REFERENCES CustomerHub (CustomerHashKey)
);
sq
