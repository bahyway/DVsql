# 2. Link

Data Vault v.1.0:

In Data Vault v.1.0, the LINK table is used to store the relationships between two HUB tables. The LINK table contains foreign keys that reference the HUB tables, along with any additional attributes that are relevant to the relationship.

Here is an example of a LINK table in Data Vault v.1.0:

```
CREATE TABLE CustomerOrderLink (
  CustomerID INTEGER NOT NULL,
  OrderID INTEGER NOT NULL,
  OrderDate DATETIME NOT NULL,
  CONSTRAINT PK_CustomerOrderLink PRIMARY KEY (CustomerID, OrderID),
  CONSTRAINT FK_CustomerOrderLink_CustomerHub FOREIGN KEY (CustomerID) REFERENCES CustomerHub (CustomerID),
  CONSTRAINT FK_CustomerOrderLink_OrderHub FOREIGN KEY (OrderID) REFERENCES OrderHub (OrderID)
);

```

Hash Keys are generated using a hash function based on the values of the foreign key attributes, and are used to enable faster joins and queries across the data warehouse.

To generate the Hash Keys for the LINK table in Data Vault v.2.0, a hash function can be used, similar to the example provided for the HUB table.

In summary, the LINK table in Data Vault v.1.0 and v.2.0 is used to store the relationships between two HUB tables. In v.2.0, the LINK table also includes Hash Keys, which are system-generated keys based on the values of the foreign key attributes. The Hash Keys are used to enable faster joins and queries across the data warehouse.

```
CREATE TABLE CustomerOrderLink (
  CustomerHashKey VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,
  OrderHashKey VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,
  OrderDate DATETIME NOT NULL,
  CONSTRAINT PK_CustomerOrderLink PRIMARY KEY (CustomerHashKey, OrderHashKey),
  CONSTRAINT FK_CustomerOrderLink_CustomerHub FOREIGN KEY (CustomerHashKey) REFERENCES CustomerHub (CustomerHashKey),
  CONSTRAINT FK_CustomerOrderLink_OrderHub FOREIGN KEY (OrderHashKey) REFERENCES OrderHub (OrderHashKey)
);

```

In this example, the CustomerOrderLink table contains Hash Keys that are used to link the CustomerHub and OrderHub tables, replacing the foreign keys as the primary key of the table. The Hash Keys are generated using a hash function based on the values of the foreign key attributes, and are used to enable faster joins and queries across the data warehouse.

To generate the Hash Keys for the LINK table in Data Vault v.2.0, a hash function can be used, similar to the example provided for the HUB table.

In summary, the LINK table in Data Vault v.1.0 and v.2.0 is used to store the relationships between two HUB tables. In v.2.0, the LINK table also includes Hash Keys, which are system-generated keys based on the values of the foreign key attributes. The Hash Keys are used to enable faster joins and queries across the data warehouse.
